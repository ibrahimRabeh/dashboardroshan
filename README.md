Architectural 3D Object Dashboard
Overview

This dashboard serves as a conceptual platform for architects, allowing abstract inputs to evolve into complex 3D forms. Through a process that integrates textual input and algorithmic translation, this system generates, displays, and enables downloads of 3D architectural models. The objective is to explore the nuances of spatial interpretation, where textual cues are interpreted into dimensional constructs.
Features

    Abstract 3D Object Creation: Input text is synthesized into 3D form, bringing intangible ideas into the visual plane.
    Dynamic API Integration: Text is processed by an API that interprets architectural language, shaping the input into digital models.
    Downloadable 3D Outputs: Each generated model can be examined on the dashboard and downloaded, ready for further manipulation or realization.

Technologies

    HTML & CSS: Forms the structural and stylistic foundation of the dashboard, guiding user interactions.
    JavaScript: Powers the real-time rendering, interactions, and API communications within the application.

This dashboard invites users to reimagine architectural design through the interplay of language and form, exploring a novel approach to digital architecture.
